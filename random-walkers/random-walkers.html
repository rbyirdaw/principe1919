					The random walk model consists of objects moving in random steps. Nature is filled
					with things that move in this way.  A simulation of random walkers is therefore
					very useful to learn about such natural phenomena.  
					In the simulation below, 100 random walkers take steps of unit length in any of the 
					four directions.  Click start and as the particles move randomly, 
					observe the values for mean displacement, mean square displacement and 
					the square root of the total steps taken.  Notice that 1) mean displacement is
					essentially 0 - the walkers do not really go anywhere and that 2) the rms distance 
					along x and y is equivalent to total steps*step size. Read on to discover why random walkers behave in this way.

					Albert Einstein, undoubtedly the most iconic scientific figure, presented his special theory of relativity to the world in 1905.  Although it is this work that he is most commonly associated with, that same year, Einstein published a total of four scientific works one of which earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Each of his four works had a profound impact on modern physics and as a result, these works are commonly referred to as the “annus mirabilis” or “miraculous year” papers.
				</p>
				<p>
					One topic Einstein tackled that seminal year was Brownian motion.  Exactly 50 years before Einstein was born, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, while looking at pollen grains suspended in water through a microscope, observed small particles in constant motion.  What was surprising was that the movement of the particles was purely random.  At the time, it was unclear as to how or why the particles would move in such an unpredictable way.  Following Brown’s observations, many scientists explored this phenomenon extensively.  However, it was Einstein’s 1905 work that presented a solid mathematical description, highlighting important characteristics of Brownian motion.
				</p>
				<p>
					As is often done in physics, a model can be helpful in understanding phenomena observed experimentally.  In the case of Brownian motion, the model that has been developed and used is called the random walk.  This model was also used in Einstein’s treatment of Brownian motion.  In its simplest form, the random walk model consists of particles moving randomly along a line, a plane or three dimensional space.  The random movement occurs along an axis in one of two possible directions.  For example, for particles on a line, the random steps are either backwards or forwards.  The key aspect of the model is that a step along any of the directions is equally likely to occur.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are a number of interesting questions one could ask about particles in Brownian motion.  For example, what is the average displacement of such particles, from the starting point, after a certain period of time?  Or, what is the total distance, on average, such particles will cover in a given amount of time.  Over the years, the random walk model has been studied exhaustively and has helped answer questions like these.  Prior to the availability of computers, such questions had to be addressed manually, through calculations.  Today, the random walk is commonly implemented as a simulation and so it is easy to visualize the process that leads to the answers of the above two questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the simplest cases (1 or 2 dimensional random walks), the answers to the above two questions and other interesting characteristics can be calculated.  It can be shown that, on average, the mean displacement of random walkers is essentially zero.  In other words, even though the random walkers take steps and move about the axis, plane or space, they ultimately do not go anywhere.  The reason for this is that backward and forward (or up and down) steps are equally likely to occur.  So, over a long period of time, the total steps will cancel each other out and a walker is essentially where it started.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though the mean displacement is zero, the mean of the square of the displacements is actually non-zero.  So, if we wanted to get a sense of distance covered by random walkers, we have to use this quantity instead of the mean displacement.  What is even more interesting is that, if the random walkers take unit steps each time, the mean square distance is equal to the total number of steps.
