					The Monte Carlo method is a computational method that uses random numbers to simulate a given type of event.  Since its development in the 1940s, the Monte Carlo method has advanced tremendously and is now an integral and indispensable tool in scientific research.  Fields that employ this approach range from astrophysics to biophysics to meteorology, a testament to the versatility of the method.  One attractive feature of using this tool to perform computational experiments is that all that is required is a computer â€“ no need to invest lots of money on expensive laboratory equipment, although a fancy computer is a plus.
				</p>
				<p>
					A simple demonstration of the Monte Carlo method that is commonly given is the calculation of the value of pi.  First, we draw a quarter circle and then inscribe it inside a square.  The demonstration can be done with a semi or full circle but the quarter circle is simpler.  Inscribing the quarter circle in the square means that the square and quarter circle have sides of the same length.  More importantly, the original, full, circle has radius equal to the side of the square.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step is to use the Monte Carlo method to place points randomly inside the square.  Remember that in a Monte Carlo method, random numbers are used to simulate some kind of a process.  In this case, it is the random placement of points inside the square.  So, all we really have to do is to generate two random numbers, for the x and y coordinates.  However, since random number generators give numbers in the range of 0 to 1, we will define our square to have a side of size 1.  Then, generating two random numbers will place a point inside the square.  We repeat this many times to fill the square with as many points as desired.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now comes the key part, the part that makes this whole experiment work.  As we place points inside the square, we count the total number of points placed as well as the total number of points placed inside the quarter circle. So then, if we take the ratio of the number of points inside the quarter circle to the total points placed inside the square, it will give us an approximation for the area of the quarter circle.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The beauty here is in the design of the experiment - that the ratio of the number of points is the same as the ratio of the area of the quarter circle to the area of the square. Clearly, the more points we place inside the square the better the approximation will be.  Thus, our Monte Carlo based experiment allows us to calculate the area of the quarter circle.  It is clear here to see that we can replicate this approach to find areas of any shapes and sizes, as long as we devise the experiment properly.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, back to pi.  We have illustrated how the Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the area of the quarter circle.  Given that pi is such an iconic number and also to easily illustrate the power of the Monte Carlo method, the experiment described above is commonly shown as an approximation of the value of pi.  This is done by using the relationship between the area of a circle and its radius, through pi, namely A = 4 pi r^2.  Since we set our square to have a side of 1, then pi becomes A / 4.  It is much easier to now see how the experiment works by comparing the approximate value of pi it gives us to the known value of pi, which is 3.14159 to 5 decimal places.
