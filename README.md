# principe1919
On the 29th of May, 1919, on the island of Principe, Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity was put to the test for the first time. Its predictions were subsequently confirmed to be correct. An experimental verification is the true test of a scientific concept. It can also be the ultimate demonstration of a concept. The web apps in the repo were created for this very purpose - for the illustration and demonstration of the many wonderful scientific and mathematical concepts.
